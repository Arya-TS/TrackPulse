# 🕸️ TrackPulse  
### ML-based Song Hit Predictor + Similar Track Recommender

TrackPulse is a machine learning project that predicts whether a song is likely to become a hit based on its audio features and recommends similar tracks using a k-Nearest Neighbors model.  
The app is built with Streamlit for a simple, interactive user interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts **Hit vs Not Hit**
- Displays **hit probability**
- Recommends **similar songs** using kNN
- Shows **similarity score**
- Uses custom engineered features
- Easy-to-use Streamlit UI

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User enters audio features for a song  
2. Custom combined features are generated:
   - `energy * danceability`
   - `valence * loudness`
   - `tempo * energy`
3. Values are scaled using saved `StandardScaler` objects  
4. Classification model predicts hit/not hit  
5. kNN model finds nearest songs from the dataset  
6. UI displays predictions and recommendations
